## 2.0.0

* All-new 2.0.0 docker images: [drupal-nginx](https://github.com/wodby/drupal-nginx/), [drupal-php](https://github.com/wodby/drupal-php/), [mariadb](https://github.com/wodby/mariadb/), [redis](https://github.com/wodby/redis/), [drupal-varnish](https://github.com/wodby/drupal-varnish/). You can now customize images with environment variable and override entire configs by using .tpl template (based on confd). Some images come with actions you can execute (e.g. create Solr core with Search API configs)

* Domains support via Traefik
* PHP versions: 5.3/5.6/7.0/7.1 based on officials (except 5.3)
* Extended list of PHP extensions

* Node.js optional container
* Revamped documentation
* Auto-tests for Drupal 6/7/8 via Travis

## v1.3.0

### Improvements

* IMPORTANT: MariaDB container now has no volume defined via compose file. The volume is already defined in its Dockerfile, so Docker will create and mount volume automatically. Do not use `docker-compose down` unless you want to purge your volumes. If you restart docker or use `docker-compose stop` the volume will persist
* Performance improvement for macOS (OSX) users: a new way to sync codebase files is now described. It's based on [docker-sync project](https://github.com/EugenMayer/docker-sync/). Docker is now usable for development on mac. See README.md
* New solr container (versions 5.5 and 6.3)
* Versions of images, except official, are now frozen. A new version will be released when a newer image version is available
* SSHD container is now removed from the standard set
* We now have [slack](https://slack.wodby.com) where you can any questions about docker4drupal 
* New documentation http://docs.docker4drupal.org
* Instructions updated
* License file added (MIT)
* Changelog file added

### Action Required Before Upgrading

* Since MariaDB now uses volume defined in Dockerfile instead of docker-compose, you should export your database and import it again (use mariadb-init volume for this)
* Do not use `docker-compose down` command because it will purge MariaDB volume. Instead use `docker-compose stop`. If you restart Docker you WILL NOT lose your data
